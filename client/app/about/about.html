      <p>Newsroom.Tools is an open-source online resource, collecting tried-and-tested tools for journalists producing digital news. Here journalists can easily discover tools that can help them tell their stories better, while developers can showcase their new tools and projects.</p>

      <p>We want this to be a space that will seamlessly bring journalists and developers together, while providing journalists a simple platform to explore, experiment, and implement new tools.</p>

      <p>You can help make this site even more useful by giving feedback on the tools based on your experience using them. You can do this by up- or down-voting the tools and contribute reviews, which will help to inform the quality and relevance of each listed tool over time.</p>

      <p>Newsroom.Tools is a work in progress, as we constantly fine-tune it while new tools are added and community sharing grows.</p>

      <p>This site has grown from a winning project in the Global Editors Network + BBC News Labs #NewsHack event, conceived by a team from The Times and The Sunday Times. The site is developed and managed by a team from Goldsmiths University. The BBC hosted the original hack event and the prize for the winning team was for Goldsmiths to develop the idea through to an alpha launch with development funding, critical feedback and advice from the BBC.</p>
