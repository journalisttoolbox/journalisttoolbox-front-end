  <div class="ui raised segment">
    <p>In June 2015, a small team from The Times and Sunday Times competed and won at GEN + BBC New Labs #newsHACK. We created a concept called The Journalist Toolbox, proposing that newsroom tools needed to be more accessible for journalists, and standardised to create better journalism.</p>

    <p>That would level the playing field between large news organisations and individual journalists, while also inspiring a higher overall quality of newsroom tools.</p>

    <p>The prize was a partnership with the BBC and Goldsmiths, University of London, to turn the concept into reality.</p>

    <p>The Journalist Toolbox is an open-source, online resource collecting tried-and-tested tools for journalists producing digital news.</p>

    <p>Here, journalists can easily discover tools that can help them tell their stories better, while developers can showcase their new tools and projects.</p>

    <p>We want this to be a space that will seamlessly bring journalists and developers together, while providing journalists a simple platform to explore, experiment, and implement new tools.</p>

    <p>You can help make this site even more useful by giving feedback on the tools based on your experience using them. You can do this by up- or down-voting the tools and contribute reviews, which will help to inform the quality and relevance of each listed tool over time.</p>

    <p>You will also be able to create and store private lists based on your favourite, most-frequently-used tools, and share and embed these lists, similar to playlists on Spotify and Pandora.</p>

    <p>The Journalist Toolbox is a work in progress, as we constantly fine-tune it while new tools are added and community sharing grows.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or thoughts about the project, weâ€™d love to hear from you: team@newsroom.tools.</p>
