      <p>In June 2015,<a href="https://medium.com/the-journalist-toolbox/we-need-to-standardise-tools-for-journalists-and-here-s-how-9bde2e952f2b#.707odbtno">&nbsp;a small team </a>from The Times and Sunday Times competed and won at GEN + <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/news-hack/">BBC News Labs #newsHACK</a>. We created a concept called The Journalist Toolbox, proposing that newsroom tools needed to be more accessible for journalists, and standardised to create better journalism.</p>
      <p>That would level the playing field between large news organisations and individual journalists, while also inspiring a higher overall quality of newsroom tools.</p>
      <p>The prize was a partnership with the BBC and Goldsmiths, University of London, to <a href="https://medium.com/the-journalist-toolbox/assembling-the-journalist-toolbox-3ef80dda7db8#.olfhlwchp">turn the concept into reality</a>.</p>
      <p>The Journalist Toolbox is an open-source, online resource collecting tried-and-tested tools for journalists producing digital news.</p>
      <p>Here, journalists can easily discover tools that can help them tell their stories better, while developers can showcase their new tools and projects. </p>
      <p>We want this to be a space that will seamlessly bring journalists and <a ui-sref="create">developers</a> together, while providing journalists a simple platform to explore, experiment, and implement new tools.</p>
      <p>You can help make this site even more useful by giving feedback on the tools based on your experience using them. You can do this by up- or down-voting the tools and contribute reviews, which will help to inform the quality and relevance of each listed tool over time.</p>
      <p>You will also be able to <a ui-sref="admin.lists">create and store private lists</a> based on your favourite, most-frequently-used tools, and share and embed these lists, similar to playlists on Spotify and Pandora.</p>
      <p>The Journalist Toolbox is a work in progress, as we constantly fine-tune it while new tools are added and community sharing grows.</p>
